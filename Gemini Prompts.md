Prompt 1

Can you create a nextjs page that can be used to:

1\. add, remove, or adjust schedule events in the action, event, time format?

* Action: State the command clearly. The most common actions are Add, Remove, or Reschedule.
* Event: Name the specific event and its duration (e.g., "Squadron Meeting (1h)", "Physics Study (2h block)").
* Time: Auto (you will determine when the best time to complete a portion of this task will be)
* On the page should be 3 input elements that are stacked on top of each other in a sleek manner. The top input element should be action, the middle input element should be event, and the bottom input element should be time.
* Next to those input elements should be an add button.
* Once the schedule event is created, it should be displayed somewhere on the page that makes sense from a css layout perspective.
* I also want the schedule event stored into a json file or an sql file that can be downloaded by a user once all the events have been added. Make a button that will do this.

The  purpose of this is to make it faster to create events, add events, and schedule.



Prompt 2

Can you add in a section that will allow me to upload my fixed appointments as a pdf?
It will have:

* My daily fixed appointments (things that must happen every day)
* My fixed appointments (fa) that I must go to every day.

The difference between the two is, fa's I go to every day are not the same every day. They are appointments that I have made with others before time like class. You have to schedule around those.
My daily fa's are mandatory events that I have to do on a daily basis.
